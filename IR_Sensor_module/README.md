# README.md for IR-sensor module.

## Used for object detection or distance detection, fixed and sorted using the potentiometer provided, increase or decrease in sensitivity is directly related to the core increase or decrease of the reading limits

### Uses the IR led to emit IR rays and uses the Photo Diode to recieve the emitted rays. Use of resistors to limit the current flow into the LED's to stop over-powering the LED's.
