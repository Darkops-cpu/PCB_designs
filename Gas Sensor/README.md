# README.md for Gas Sensor.

## the components used are mentioned below:
### 1. MQ family module (6 pin)
### 2. resistors, values indicated against them (all in ohms)
### 3. capacitors, values indicated against them (all in micro C)
### 4. LM393DRE4 (any LM393D can be used)
### 5. 2 LED
### 5. potentiometer (value mentioned against it)

## This schematic is for the sensors of MQ family, tho already pre made stable sensors exit in market this is made to custom needs for projects where those pre made bulky senors cant be used as they increase the height and clearence of the circuit, which may not be applicaable for every project and specially if the project has to be small and flat.
