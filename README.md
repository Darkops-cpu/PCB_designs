## ‚ö°Ô∏è Overview

Welcome to the **PCB_designs** repository! This repository serves as a centralized collection of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs, primarily focusing on custom circuits and builds. Whether you're looking for inspiration, detailed schematics, or ready-to-manufacture files, you'll find them here.

My goal is to share robust and tested PCB layouts, enabling others in the open-source hardware community to borrow, build, and iterate on custom solutions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Diverse Designs:** A growing collection of PCB designs for various components.
* **Open Source:** All designs are provided under an open-source license, encouraging collaboration and modification.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Each design aims to include comprehensive documentation, such as schematics, layout files, and gerber files.
* **KiCad/EasyEDA/other-open source compatibility:** Designs are typically created using popular open-source EDA tools like KiCad, ensuring accessibility.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore or utilize these PCB designs, you'll need appropriate EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software. I primarily use **KiCad/EasyEDA**, which are powerful and free open-source suite.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Darkops-cpu/PCB_designs.git](https://github.com/Darkops-cpu/PCB_designs.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project:**
    ```bash
    cd PCB_designs
    ```
3.  **Open Designs:** Navigate into the specific design folders and open the project files using your preferred EDA software.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each main folder within this repository represents a distinct PCB project. Inside each project folder, you can expect to find:

* `README.md/`: A `README.md` that has a bit of details for the schematic files.
* `.png/jpg/jpeg/svg/`: Schematic images that shows the connects and the modules in use for the PCB design.
* `gerbers/`: A `.zip` files containing all the gerber files for the use over various software.
* `3d_models/` (optional): 3D renderings or models of the PCB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Designs

Here's a list of some of the PCB designs currently available in this repository:

* **Gas Sensor:** Files containing sketch for Gas Sensor schematics specifically the MQ family.
* **IR Sensor Module:** Designs and sketch for an IR Sensor module.
* **Temperature and Humidity Circuit:** This is a PCB schematic for a circuit that includes an MQ sensor and a DHT22 sensor, which is paired with an ESP Dev board.

*(Note: This list will be updated as new designs are added.)*
