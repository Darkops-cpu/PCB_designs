# README.md for Temp and Humidity data collector and observer

## Components used:
### 1. ESP32
### 2. DHT22
### 3. MQ2
### 4. MQ3

## MQ2 and 3 used in the schematic and the pcb design are the ones which have been already prehand optimised, that means, their 6 pin communication has been oriendted to just 4 pins, those being vcc, gnd, a0, and d0.

## the same goes for DHT22, the 4 pin communication has been reduced to a 3 pin communication being vcc, gnd, and output.

## standard ESP32 has been used.
